# Full Stack Web Dev Learning 

After seriously considering about enrolling General Assembly Web Development Immersive. I decided to make use of online resourse instead and learn it myself (Reasons are GA is too expensive and I believe in myself). There are Udacity and Coursera that I mostly used to learn the materials. And this repo is meant to keep track of my learning. My goal is simple: be a great coder, web developer and to make impacts.

## Curriculum
A curriculum is needed so that a clear roadmap of what I am gonna learn will help me keep my learning on track even the courses that I enrolled may already has their own topic. As I am a CS student with little web development, I could still outline the topics I should cover. To make a whole picture of the learning, I referenced to GA's [WDI course curriculum](WDI_CourseCurriculum_v2.0.pdf) and Coursera's Full stack web development course.

#### Unit 1: FRONT-END DEVELOPMENT(expected days: 14-21 days)
At the end of Unit 1, spend a few days building a front-end game using technologies like HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. The objective of the project is to:

 - Create an interactive game in the browser
 - Apply foundational programming skills to game logic
 - Document my project workflow

## References
In order to cover as many topics as possible for my learning, I tried to follow the topics in [WDI course curriculum](WDI_CourseCurriculum_v2.0.pdf). Instead, I search for relevant tutorials/documents myself to learn the topics. details and references are recorded in [here](scope-details-and-reference.md).
