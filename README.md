# Full Stack Web Dev Learning 

After seriously considering about enrolling General Assembly Web Development Immersive. I decided to make use of online resourse instead and learn it myself (Reasons are GA is too expensive and I believe in myself). There are Udacity and Coursera that I mostly used to learn the materials. And this repo is meant to keep track of my learning. My goal is simple: be a great coder, web developer and to make impacts.

## References
In order to cover as many topics as possible for my learning, I tried to follow the topics in [WDI course curriculum](WDI_CourseCurriculum_v2.0.pdf). Instead of attending GA, I search for relevant tutorials/documents myself to learn the topics. details and references are recorded in [here](scope-details-and-reference.md).
