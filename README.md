# Full Stack Web Dev Learning 

This is to provide resources that I used to learn web development at home. There are many ways people launch their career/dream as a web developer, they might be a programming enthusiast at child age, borned to be a genius, got their CS degree in college, getting into a bootcamp, etc. I had my CS degree but I was not interested in programming in college. I started to love it when I got very bored at my software consulting work after graduated. I tried to learn ruby & then rails at weekends and I built my interests on development. There are so many resources on the internet for people to learn those technique and of course some of them are well structured and some of materials are very scattered. I learned great things from those great resources and I feel the need to document the them for those who also want to start to explore in this path with the hope of some quality resources.
