# Full Stack Web Dev Learning 

I have never been in this high spirit.
After seriously considering about enrolling General Assembly Web Development Immersive. I decided to make use of online resourse instead and learn it myself (Reasons are GA is too expensive and I believe in myself). There are Udacity and Coursera that I mostly used to learn the materials. And this repo is meant to keep track of my learning. My goal is simple: be a great coder, web developer and to make impacts.

## Directory Structure
```
├── coursera-courseworks

        └── project
            ├── css
            ├── images
            └── js
```
